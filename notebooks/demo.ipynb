For example, variables starting with letters I-N are integers by default, while others are real numbers.\\n\\n### Differences from Fortran 90\\n\\n1. **Free-Format Source Code:**\\n   - Fortran 90 introduced free-format source code, allowing more flexibility in code layout and removing the rigid column restrictions.\\n\\n2. **Enhanced Commenting:**\\n   - In Fortran 90, comments are denoted by an exclamation mark `!`, which can appear anywhere in a line, offering more flexibility.\\n\\n3. **Advanced Features:**\\n   - Fortran 90 introduced many modern programming features, such as modules, array operations, recursion, and dynamic memory allocation, which enhance code organization and functionality.\\n\\n4. **Improved Code Structure:**\\n   - Fortran 90 supports structured programming with constructs like `DO` loops and `IF` statements with `END DO` and `END IF`, improving code readability and maintainability.\\n\\n### Importance of Fortran'}],\n",

One of its unique aspects was the use of fixed column positions in the source code:\\n\\n- **Columns 1-5**: Reserved for statement labels, which are optional and used for reference in control statements.\\n- **Column 6**: Used for continuation lines. If a statement extends beyond one line, a character (often `&`) in column 6 of the next line indicates continuation.\\n- **Columns 7-72**: Used for writing actual code statements.\\n- **Columns 73-80**: Typically ignored, historically used for sequence numbers on punched cards.\\n\\n### Example'}],\n",

They are used to describe the code and are ignored by the compiler.\\n\\n3. **Case Insensitivity**: Fortran is not case-sensitive, meaning `area`, `AREA`, and `Area` are considered the same identifier.\\n\\n4. **Statements and Syntax**: Fortran 77 uses a simple syntax with a focus on mathematical expressions. It lacks many modern constructs like modules or object-oriented features.\\n\\n### Differences from Modern Languages\\n\\n- **Free-Form Syntax**: Modern languages like Python, C++, and Java use free-form syntax, allowing more flexibility in code formatting.\\n- **Advanced Data Structures**: Modern languages support complex data structures like objects and classes, which are not present in Fortran 77.\\n- **Error Handling**: Modern languages provide robust error handling mechanisms, whereas Fortran 77 relies on simpler constructs.\\n-'}]]"
