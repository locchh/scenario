These rules dictate how code is structured within a line, impacting readability and functionality. Here are the key column position rules:\\n\\n1. **Columns 1-5**: These columns are reserved for statement labels, which are optional. Statement labels are numeric and are used for identifying statements, especially for branching and looping.\\n\\n2. **Column 6**: This column is used for continuation lines. If a statement is too long to fit on one line, a character (often a non-blank character like a plus sign `+` or any other character) placed in column 6 of the next line indicates that the line is a continuation of the previous line.\\n\\n3. **Columns 7-72**: These columns are used for the actual Fortran statements. The code must start from column 7 and can extend up to column 72. Any characters beyond column 72 are ignored by the compiler.\\n\\n4. **Column 73-80**: These columns are typically ignored by the compiler and can be used for sequence numbers or other identifiers, although this practice is largely obsolete.\\n\\n5. **Comment Lines**: A comment line is indicated by a `C`, `c`, or `*` in column 1. The rest of the line is ignored by the compiler and can be used for comments.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nBelow is an example illustrating these rules:\\n\\n```fortran\\n      PROGRAM Example\\nC This is a comment line\\n      INTEGER :: i, sum\\n      sum = 0\\n      DO 10 i = 1, 10\\n          sum = sum + i\\n10    CONTINUE\\n      PRINT *, 'Sum of first 10 integers is ', sum\\n      END\\n```\\n\\n### Continuation Example\\n\\nHere's an example of a statement that continues onto the next line:\\n\\n```fortran\\n      PROGRAM ContinuationExample\\n      INTEGER :: a, b, c\\n      a = 1\\n      b = 2\\n      c = 3\\n      PRINT *, 'The sum of a, b, and c is ', a + b + c\\n      PRINT *, 'This is a very long statement that needs to be continued' + \\n     + ' onto the next line.'\\n      END\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `+` in column 6 of the second line indicates that the statement is continued from the previous line.

If a line is too long and needs to be continued on the next line, any character (usually a space or a specific character like `&`) placed in column 6 of the subsequent line signals that it is a continuation of the previous line.\\n\\n3. **Columns 7-72**: These columns are used for the actual code statements.

Any text following this character on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by the compiler.\\n\\n### Continuation Lines\\n\\n- If a line of code is too long to fit within columns 7-72, it can be continued on the next line by placing any character in column 6 of the continuation line. This allows the logical line to extend across multiple physical lines.\\n\\n### Example: Calculating the Area of a Circle\\n\\nHere's a Fortran 77 code snippet that calculates the area of a circle, adhering to these formatting rules:\\n\\n```fortran\\n      program circle\\n      real r, area\\nC This program reads a real number r and prints\\nC the area of a circle with radius r.\\n      write (*,*) 'Give radius r:'\\n      read (*,*) r\\n      area = 3.14159*r*r\\n      write (*,*) 'Area = ', area\\n      stop\\n      end\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n- The `program` and `real` statements start at column 7.\\n- Comments start with `C` in column 1.\\n- The `write`, `read`, and `stop` statements also begin at column 7.\\n- The expression `area = 3\"}],\n",

They start with a 'c' in column 1, so the entire line is treated as a comment.\\n\\n- **Statement Splitting:** The `area` assignment statement is too long to fit on one line, so it is split across two lines. The first part of the statement (`area = 3.14159`) is written on the first line. The continuation line starts with a character (in this case, a `+`) in column 6, indicating that it continues the previous line.
