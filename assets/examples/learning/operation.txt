In mainframe system management, an Initial Program Load (IPL) is the process of starting or restarting 
an IBM mainframe computer by loading the operating system and initializing hardware components.
It is typically performed after a system reset, a hardware failure, or during regular maintenance.
The IPL process involves a series of methodical steps, including ensuring that critical jobs are stopped,
selecting the system to IPL, and specifying the load source.
This process must be performed carefully to avoid errors and ensure the system initializes properly.
The following are the key steps involved in performing an IPL on an IBM mainframe:

1. Ensure all critical jobs are stopped and the system is backed up.
2. Enter the hardware management console (HMC) and select the system to IPL.
3. Specify the LOADPARM value to determine the load source.
4. Start the system by selecting the "Load" option.
5. Monitor the console for successful startup messages.
