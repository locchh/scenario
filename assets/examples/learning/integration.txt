Integrating legacy mainframe systems with modern applications often involves exposing the mainframe data 
to external systems via RESTful APIs. IBM z/OS Connect is a key tool for this, 
as it enables mainframe data and services to be accessed through APIs. 
The integration process includes mapping traditional data structures, such as COBOL copybooks or database schemas, 
to API schemas. Securing the APIs is essential, often implemented through standards 
like TLS and OAuth 2.0 to protect sensitive data during exchange. Testing the API endpoints 
can be done using popular tools like Postman or curl, ensuring that the APIs work as expected. 
Once the integration is in place, continuous monitoring of the API usage through analytics tools is critical 
for tracking performance and ensuring efficient data exchange.
