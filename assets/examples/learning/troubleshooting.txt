When troubleshooting high CPU usage on an IBM z/OS mainframe system,
itâ€™s important to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause.
First, using the **Resource Measurement Facility (RMF)** tool is crucial 
to monitor CPU utilization and gather detailed performance data.
By reviewing RMF reports, you can pinpoint which processes are consuming excessive CPU resources.
Next, check for any **long-running or looping jobs** that may be hogging the CPU.
Terminating or adjusting these processes can often help alleviate the issue.
Additionally, reviewing **Workload Manager (WLM)** policies ensures that system resources are being allocated efficiently.
Finally, a thorough analysis of **system logs** is necessary to detect any errors, failures, or unusual activity that may contribute to high CPU usage.
