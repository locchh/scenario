Mainframe systems are powerful, centralized computing platforms designed to 
handle vast amounts of data and support thousands of users simultaneously.
They are known for their reliability, scalability, and high throughput,
making them ideal for critical applications that require secure, uninterrupted processing.
Mainframes are commonly employed in industries such as banking, healthcare,
and government to perform tasks like transaction processing, batch jobs, and managing large databases.
Their architecture is optimized for heavy workloads, ensuring efficiency in data management and enterprise-level operations.
