When managing a z/OS system, system administrators often need to monitor the active jobs running on the mainframe.
This is essential for tracking system performance, resource usage, and troubleshooting potential issues.
To list all currently active jobs, the z/OS command DISPLAY ACTIVE is used.
This command displays a list of all jobs that are actively running on the system,
allowing administrators to quickly assess the system's job workload.
