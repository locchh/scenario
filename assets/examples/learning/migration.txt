Migrating an application from a mainframe environment to a cloud platform involves several stages,
including assessing the current application architecture, selecting a suitable cloud platform,
and ensuring the application is compatible with cloud environments.
The migration process also requires identifying the mainframe-specific components (such as COBOL programs and JCL scripts)
and choosing an appropriate migration strategy, like rehosting (lift-and-shift) or refactoring the application
for cloud-native features.

Key steps involved in the migration process include:
- Assessing the Application Architecture: Before migration, a thorough understanding of the application’s architecture and its dependencies is essential. This helps identify the specific requirements for moving the application to the cloud.
- Identifying Mainframe-Specific Components: Mainframe applications often use unique components like COBOL programs, JCL scripts, and VSAM files. Identifying these elements is crucial for ensuring that they are properly handled during migration.
- Choosing the Cloud Platform and Migration Strategy: Selecting a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and determining the migration strategy are key decisions. The strategy could involve rehosting, where the application is moved with minimal changes, or refactoring, where the application is restructured to take advantage of cloud-native features.
- Converting Data: Mainframe systems typically use specialized file formats like VSAM, so converting this data into a format that is compatible with cloud storage systems (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL databases) is a critical step.
- Testing the Migrated Application: After the migration, it is important to test the application in the cloud environment to ensure that it functions as expected and meets the performance and scalability needs of the business.
- Validating Performance and Reliability: Finally, the migrated application’s performance and reliability should be validated before decommissioning the mainframe system, ensuring that the cloud environment delivers the necessary capabilities.
