When a job terminates abnormally in a mainframe environment,
it is often accompanied by an error message that provides a clue about the issue.
Common error messages like "IEF450I JOB ABEND" indicate that the job encountered an abnormal termination (abend).
The error could be caused by various factors, such as missing resources, invalid job parameters,
or issues within the system environment.
Identifying the specific abend code provided in the job log (such as S222 or S806) can help in pinpointing the exact problem.
To resolve the issue, the job log should be carefully reviewed to identify the root cause,
and appropriate corrective actions should be taken, such as ensuring all required resources are available or correcting the job parameters.
Once the issue is fixed, the job can be rerun successfully.
